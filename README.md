Welcome to the tora logging library.

### Installation

Clone the repository with
```git clone http://github.com/ccdle12/tora.c3l```
to the `./lib` folder of your C3 project and add the following to
`project.json`:

```json
{
    "dependency-search-paths": [ "lib" ],
    "dependencies": [ "tora" ]
}
```

If you didn't clone it into the `lib` folder, adjust your
`dependency-search-paths` accordingly.
